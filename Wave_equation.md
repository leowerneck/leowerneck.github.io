This is a test of subpages and mathematics. Here we will provide a few notes on how to solve the wave equation, namely

$$
\partial_{t}^{2}u(t,\vec{x}) = c^{2}\nabla^{2}^{2}u(t,\vec{x})\ ,
$$

where $nabla^{2}$ is the Laplacian operator, which in Cartesian coordinates reads

$$
\nabla^{2} = \partial_{x}^{2} + \partial_{y}^{2} + \partial_{z}^{2}\ .
$$
