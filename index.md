## About me
Hi, my name is Leonardo (Leo) Werneck, and I am currently a postdoc
reseacher at the [University of Idaho](https://www.wvu.edu/), where I am
conducting research under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Zachariah
B. Etienne](http://astro.phys.wvu.edu/zetienne/). I am also a member of
the [TCAN collaboration on Binary Neutron Stars](http://compact-binaries.org/). 
<br><br>
I have obtained my Ph.D. in Physics from the [Institute of
Physics](http://portal.if.usp.br/) of the [University of São
Paulo](https://www.usp.br/) (USP), under supervision of [Prof. Dr. Elcio
Abdalla](http://fma.if.usp.br/~eabdalla/) (see the [BINGO telescope
website](https://www.bingotelescope.org/en/)!), where we have mostly
worked with critical phenomena in the gravitational collapse of massless
scalar fields. During my Ph.D. I have visited Zach Etienne at WVU and we
have worked on extending the [equation of
state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_state) support of
[IllinoisGRMHD](https://github.com/zachetienne/nrpytutorial/tree/master/IllinoisGRMHD)
(IGM), a compact, user-friendly, and robust
[GRMHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics) code. IGM is
a rewrite of the original GRMHD code of the [Illinois Relativity
Group](http://research.physics.illinois.edu/CTA/IRG/), of the
[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/).
<br><br>
I have also obtained a M.Sc. in Physics, under supervision of
[Prof. Dr. Victor O. Rivelles](http://itec.if.usp.br/~rivelles/), and a
Teaching Degree in Physics, where my undergraduate research was
supervised by Prof. Dr. Artour G. Elfimov, both from USP.

## Research
My research fields are those of [Numerical
Relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_relativity) and
[Computational
Astrophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_astrophysics). I
have dedicated a good fraction of my Ph.D. to the study of
[gravitational
collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_collapse) of
[massless scalar
fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field_theory).
<br><br>
Currently my research focuses on the implementation of advanced
equations of state for IllinoisGRMHD, so that we can more realistically
model [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star)
(NS). We are also working on adding neutrino physics to IllinoisGRMHD.
<br><br>
[**SFcollapse1D**](https://github.com/leowerneck/SFcollapse1D) is an
open-sourced, user-friendly code I have developed during my Ph.D. which
allows the user to study the gravitational collapse of massless scalar
fields in spherical-like coordinates. The code is able to accurately
track the critical solution by making use of non-uniform numerical grids
that fully explore the symmetries of the problem and dramatically
increase the resolution near the center of the simulation. This code is
based on the [original
algorithm](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.9)
developed by [Matt
Choptuik](http://laplace.physics.ubc.ca/People/matt/), but our grid
choice allows us to solve the problem without making use of [adaptive
mesh refinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_mesh_refinement)
(AMR) routines.
<br><br>
[**NRPyCritCol**](https://github.com/leowerneck/NRPyCritCol_Ccodes) is
an open-sourced, user-friendly code [documented in pedagogical Jupyter
notebooks](https://tinyurl.com/yd5vwrak) to study critical collapse
using the [BSSN formulation of Einstein's
equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5377). It uses the [NRPy+
infrastructure](http://nrpyplus.net) to generate highly optimized C code
(with [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) and
[CSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_subexpression_elimination)
support) that allows for robust evolution of the [Klein-Gordon
equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein–Gordon_equation) of a
massless scalar field minimally coupled to the spacetime metric.

## Misc

I love cooking in general and baking in particular. I usually love
making simple, yet delicious, Brazilian desserts and treats, such as
[*brigadeiros*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadeiro), [walnut or
pecan
*camafeus*](https://www.receitasnestle.com.br/receitas/camafeu-de-nozes)
(couldn't find a link in English, sorry), and
[*pudins*](https://www.receitasnestle.com.br/receitas/pudim-de-leite-moca)
(which is the Brazilian version of [crème
caramel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%A8me_caramel)). I also love
making traditional North American treats like chocolate chip cookies,
apple or pecan pies, pancakes, burgers, pizzas, and many more!
<br><br>
I have always loved eating bread, but never had success in making a loaf
from scratch and baking it in my home oven. During the [2019-2020
COVID-19
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic),
I have had a lot of time at home to practice and improve my bread making
skills and got fairly decent at it. I fell in love with [artisan
sourdough loaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough), specifically
because of the fact that they take so long to make but require very
little human interaction, which is perfect for my daily routine. I plan
on sharing some recipes (or, more accuratelly, *formulas*) and tips for
sourdough baking in the future.
